# Make Your App Material
===================================

## XYZ Reader: A mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and headlines. 

Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.

Required Tasks:
------------------------

* Download a zip file of the app.
* Read the UI Review in the next node.
* Spend time exploring the current state of the app, looking for ways it could be improved. The app will need multiple    improvements. Be sure to look specifically at issues called out in the UI Review.
Execute the improvements!


## User Feedback for XYZ Reader:


__Lyla says:__
“This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”

__Jay says:__
“Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."

__Kagure says:__
“The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”
